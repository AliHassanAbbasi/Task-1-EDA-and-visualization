# Task-1-EDA-and-visualization
Titanic Dataset Analysis and Visualization
This project is part of my internship tasks, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using Python and Power BI. The goal is to gain insights from the Titanic dataset, including survival rates based on various attributes, and to present findings through an interactive dashboard.

Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for data analysis and visualization projects. The key objectives of this project include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the dataset structure.
Handle missing and duplicate values.
Generate statistical summaries and insights.
Data Cleaning:

Address missing values using simple imputation methods.
Remove any duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
Data Visualization:

Visualize categorical and numerical data to uncover trends.
Create an interactive dashboard to present key findings.
Key Observations:

Summarize insights to understand the survival patterns of Titanic passengers.
Features of the Dashboard
The interactive dashboard provides the following insights:

Passenger Survival Overview:

Total passengers: 418
Survived passengers: 152 (36.36%)
Deceased passengers: 266 (63.64%)
Passenger Demographics:

Gender distribution: A pie chart shows survival rates by gender.
Passenger class: A bar chart displays survival by ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
Survival Analysis by Relationships:

A bar chart presents survival rates based on siblings aboard the Titanic.
Another chart analyzes survival based on the number of parents/children (Parch) on board.
Summary Statistics:

A correlation heatmap is used to understand relationships between features.

Key Insights
Gender Impact on Survival:

Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
Class-Based Survival Trends:

Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive compared to those in 3rd class.
Family Influence on Survival:

Passengers with fewer siblings had higher survival rates.
Overall Trends:

Class and gender played a significant role in determining survival chances.
